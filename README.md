# Virtual Cycling Environment (VCE)

Virtual Cycling Environment for interactive bicycling experiments with vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication.

See our [website](https://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/software/vce/) for more information.

## Summary

In order to trace and record realistic and reliable cyclist behavior, we developed the Virtual Cycling Environment (VCE).
It allows cyclists to ride a virtual bicycle in a 3D virtual reality environment by interacting with a physical bicycle on a training stand.
Foreign traffic (i.e., cars) and wireless networking are provided by the specialized simulators SUMO and Veins, respectively.
The physical bike simulator is then coupled via the Ego-Vehicle Interface (EVI) to this simulation platform.
The VCE provides a high degree of realism to the cyclist, thanks to the haptics of a physical bicycle combined with virtual reality systems.
Researchers can leverage this to study the interaction of cyclists and their traffic environment without the danger of physical harm.
Thanks to the coupling to Veins, even future assistance systems relying on communication can be tested.

## Installation Instructions and Documentation

You can find detailed information instructions in our [documentation](https://vce.readthedocs.io).
Refer to [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) if you want to build the documentation yourself.

### Quick Start

```bash
scripts/vce-install-container.sh
scripts/vce-launcher.py --container scenarios/example-intersection/network.launcher.toml
```

## Components

You can find all components of the Virtual Cycling Environment within the following directories:

```
bike-android-app  # android app for measuring the angle of the steering handle
bike-interface  # scripts for the hardware interfacing with the physical bicycle
3denv  # tools for visualizing the environment with Unity
evi  # the Ego-Vehicle Interface (EVI)
evi-asm-protocol  # the Google Protobuf definitions for the Ego-Vehicle Interface (EVI)
veins-evi  # the Veins subproject for the Ego-Vehicle Interface (EVI)
```
