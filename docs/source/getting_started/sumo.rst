SUMO
====

In the Virtual Cycling Environment (VCE), `Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) <https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/>`_ is responsible for simulating the movement of any vehicle that is not interactively controlled by a person.
In the best case, the VCE will work with the newest version of SUMO (most recently tested with 1.9.0).

.. note::
   If you are using :ref:`the VCE container<apptainer-getting-started>`, you may skip this step since an installation of SUMO is already contained.

It is likely that at some point you will want to build SUMO from source.
To do so, clone the `git repository <https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/Linux_Build.html>`_ and carefully follow the `instructions <https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/Linux_Build.html>`_.
