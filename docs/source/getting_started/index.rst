Getting Started
===============

This guide will give you an overview of the steps needed to run your first simulations with the Virtual Cycling Environment (VCE).
It is possible to follow these steps without having a sensors-equipped bicycle available.
In that case, omit running the :ref:`bicycleinterface-getting-started` and use keyboard controls in the :ref:`3denv-getting-started` instead.
For instructions on how to set up the bicycle, read :ref:`hardware-setup`.
